# AIDA Arbitrage Betting Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is part of a web scraping challenge for my AI & Data Analysis master's program. The objective is to explore web scraping techniques by extracting and analyzing live betting odds data to identify potential arbitrage opportunities.

## Project Description

For this web scraping assignment, I chose to focus on the **PSG vs Atletico Madrid** football match. The project involves:

1. **Data Collection**: Scraping live betting odds from multiple betting sources during the match
2. **Data Storage**: Publishing scraped data to a local MongoDB instance
3. **Analysis**: Post-match analysis to identify arbitrage opportunities that occurred during the game

## What is Arbitrage Betting?

Arbitrage betting is a strategy that involves placing bets on all possible outcomes of an event across different bookmakers to guarantee a profit regardless of the result. This occurs when bookmakers offer different odds for the same event, creating opportunities where the combined probability is less than 100%.

## Project Structure

- **Scrapers**: Multiple web scrapers targeting different betting platforms
- **Database**: Local MongoDB instance for real-time data storage
- **Analysis**: Data analysis notebooks to identify arbitrage opportunities

## Technical Stack

- **Python**: Main programming language
- **MongoDB**: Database for storing betting odds data
- **Jupyter Notebooks**: For data analysis and visualization
- **Web Scraping Libraries**: For extracting betting odds from various sources

## Goals

1. Successfully scrape live betting odds from multiple sources
2. Store data efficiently in MongoDB with proper timestamps
3. Analyze the collected data to identify arbitrage opportunities
4. Visualize odds movements and potential profit margins over time

## Academic Context

This project demonstrates practical application of web scraping techniques learned in the AI & Data Analysis master's program, focusing on real-time data collection and financial data analysis.
